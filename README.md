# NotesMD

Small webserver for wiki style editing of markdown notes.

Yes there are a lot of markdown style note taking applications and I tried a few and there is no ideal app for me so I figured, let's learn go and write one.

## Building app

    go build notesmd.go

## Running the application

    ./notesmd
